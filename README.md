## About Wavecon:-

Wavecon, a premier telecom provider in India, introduced its 5G services in May 2022 across major cities, alongside other telecom providers. This analysis evaluates the performance of Wavecon's 5G rollout in 15 key urban centers, aiming to uncover insights into the impact of 5G on revenue, plan performance, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Insights from this analysis:- 

ðŸ’¸ Revenue Impact: The 5G launch had a slight effect on revenue, dipping slightly from $16B to $15.9B.

ðŸ“‰ User Engagement: There is a decline in active users (AU) and an increase in unsubscribed users (TUSU), indicating potential challenges in user engagement.

ðŸ“Š Plan Performance: Certain plans excelled post-5G launch, driving robust revenue. However, some saw a drop, highlighting areas for improvement and optimization.

ðŸŒŸ Star Performers: Plan 1, Plan 11, and Plan 12 stood out as the best-performing plans.

ðŸš« Discontinued Plans: Some plans, such as P8, P9, and P10, were phased out post-5G launch due to low demand and redundancy in the product lineup.

ðŸ“ˆ Total Unsubscribed Users (TUSU): Except for Mumbai (-12.36%), the TUSU change is positive for all cities, with Lucknow, Pune, and Jaipur showing significant increases (above 50%).

These insights will help Wavecon optimize its revenue and strategize for future growth. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
